I am a broadly skilled self and academically trained Computer programmer dealing with designs such as web, traditional and mobile application development offering over 3 years experience from within a number of high pressure environments and the application technology. My experience is vast and covers provision of tactical competitive information, database, frontend and backend development.

Through experience in a variety of software deelopment (Ubuntu, Docker, Heroku, Azure, AWS, Postgres, MangoDB, Sidekiq, Git, Django, Ruby on Rails, Atom, Vscode, Redis, Sentry, Rspec, Elasticsearch etc.)I am able to quickly adapt to most development roles. Additionally, I have a worked in a start-up software development company interacting directly with the clients from requirements elicitation to deployment of their solutions.

## How I keep my skills sharp

* I am part of the Codewars forum where I regularly solve logic problems using a language of my choice which could be Ruby or Python in my case as well as follow-up on the different ways in which other people solve the same problem. I also like to interact with others on those problems to get a better insight of the solutions that give a better run-time and saves a bit of memory.
* I read articles on software development every morning on Medium
* I am currently working on [earlybirds.co.za](https://www.earlybirds.co.za) as a side project
* I recently built a Hospital management App with Django and bootstrap and deployed to Heroku.
* I am currently reading Fundamentals of python: First Programs and Professional Heroku Programmer
